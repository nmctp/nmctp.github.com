<pre>NOKEY(1)                        Authentication                        NOKEY(1)

<strong>NAME</strong>
       <strong>nokey</strong> - safe autentication using Shamir's no key protocol

<strong>SYNOPSIS</strong>
       <strong>nokey [</strong><em>options</em><strong>] [</strong><em>file</em><strong>] [</strong><em>number</em><strong>]</strong>

<strong>DESCRIPTION
</strong>       <strong>nokey</strong> is a utility for providing secure authentication through an inse-
       cure channel using Shamir's no key (or three-pass)  protocol  over  the
       group  of  units Z/p (p being a <em>large</em> prime number, designated from now
       on as the <em>modulus</em>).

       The advantages of the three-pass protocol for authentication are mainly
       two:  that  passwords  are not sent in the clear over the communication
       channel and that it needs no certificates or the overload of Public Key
       Infrastructure (the authentication server might as well fix a new modu-
       lus  for  each  authentication  attempt,  though  this  would  be  very
       resource-intensive).

       Moreover,  many  of the Web 2.0 services, such as blogs, chat services,
       and wikis require <em>only secure authentication</em> (in other words, that  the
       login/password  pair  is only known to the owner) because virtually all
       of their content is made public.

       Users of webmail servers may also be  eager  to  trade  non-privacy  of
       their  mail  (letting  it  go  through the web on the clear) for secure
       authentication (safe encryption of the login protocol). Actually,  they
       are trading for nothing nowadays in most cases.

<strong>THE PROTOCOL</strong>
       Shamir's  no  key  protocol with modulus <em>p</em> works as follows (assume the
       key -password- is a integer number <em>k</em> between 2 and p-1):

       <strong>init</strong>           The authentication <em>server</em> provides the <em>client</em>  with  the
                      modulus <em>p</em>

       <strong>encryption 1</strong>   The  <em>client</em>  chooses a random number <em>u1</em>, which is a unit
                      modulo <em>p-1</em> and computes <em>q1</em> = k^u1 mod(p) [k to the power
                      u1 modulo p]. The client sends <em>q1</em> to the server.

       <strong>encryption 2</strong>   The  <em>server</em>  chooses  another random unit <em>u2</em> modulo <em>p-1</em>,
                      and computes <em>q2</em> = q1^u2 mod(p), sending this back to the
                      client.

       <strong>decryption 1</strong>   The  <em>client</em>  computes v1 = 1/u1 mod(p-1) (the inverse of
                      u1 modulo p-1) and  sends  <em>q3</em>  =  q2^v1  mod(p)  to  the
                      server.

       <strong>decryption 2</strong>   Finally, the <em>server</em> computes <em>v2</em> = 1/u2 mod(p-1) and <em>q4</em> =
                      q3^v2 mod(p). By Fermat's little theorem, one has <em>q4</em> = k
                      mod(p),  and  the  server  can  now  verify the password
                      against its database.

       The command <em>no_key_server</em> runs the server-side of  the  protocol.   The
       client  side  has  to  be implemented specifically (although the source
       code includes a test client for convenience). As the algorithm requires
       keeping  track  of  the modulus (unless it is stored in a configuration
       file) and of the unit <em>u2</em>, the server behaves differently  depending  on
       the number of parameters it receives:

       <strong>(no params)</strong>    When called with no parameters, <strong>nokey</strong> assumes the client
                      is initiating the communication, and sends back a  file-
                      name (without path) and the modulus (either computing it
                      or reading it from a configuration file), separated by a
                      space.  The  filename  is  used  as a 'session-tracking'
                      mechanism.

      <strong> no_key_server</strong> <em>file q1</em>
                      If <strong>nokey</strong> is called  with  exactly  two  parameters,  the
                      first  one  is  assumed  to  be  a filename (the session
                      tracking file) without leading path (the session  direc-
                      tory  is known by the server) and the second is the num-
                      ber q1 (as described above in <strong>encryption 1</strong>). The  server
                      returns  a  string composed of the same filename and the
                      number q2 separated by a space.

       <strong>no_key_server</strong> <em>file q3 1</em>
                      When called with exactly three parameters (the last  '1'
                      may  be  anything), <strong>nokey</strong> performs the <strong>decryption 2</strong> step
                      and returns the number <em>q4</em> in binary form.

       After all these steps, if the cilent has sent <em>q1</em> and <em>q3</em>  properly,  the
       last output coincides with the 'password' (modulo p). If the password <strong>k</strong>
       is, as a number, less than p, then <strong>q4 = k</strong>.

       The size of p, by default, is 512 bits. This allows for  512/8=64  bit-
       long  passwords, which "<strong>ought to be sufficient</strong>" for most practical pur-
       poses.
<strong>
OPTIONS</strong>
       <strong>no_key_server</strong> supports the following options:

       <strong>-c</strong> <em>filename</em>    Specify a different modulus file <em>filename</em>.  If  it  does
                      not  exist,  then  <strong>nokey</strong> will compute a new modulus and
                      <em>try</em> to store it at <em>filename</em> (for later  use),  but  will
                      not  complain  or  fail if it cannot write to that file.
                      Default: <em>/etc/nokey.mod</em>.

       <strong>-t</strong> <em>dir</em>         Use a <em>dir</em> to store temporary files. Default: <em>/tmp</em>.

       <strong>-p</strong> <em>number</em>      Use <em>number</em> as the modulus, instead of reading it from  a
                      file  or  computing it. In this case, <em>number</em> must be the
                      hexadecimal expression of a prime number. <em>nokey</em> makes  a
                      fast check about its primality, but <em>it mostly trusts the
                      user</em>.

       <strong>-s</strong>             Run as a TCP server. This is still undocumented.

       <strong>-P</strong> <em>port</em>        Use port <em>port</em> to listen on, when  running  as  a  server
                      with the <strong>-s</strong> option, otherwise useless.
<strong>
NOTES ON USAGE</strong>
<strong>SECURITY</strong>
       The  security  of <strong>nokey</strong> relies on the difficulty of the discrete- loga-
       rithm problem, which up to date is assumed enough for the same sizes as
       RSA  keys  (that  is, about 2048 bits in 2008). For most practical pur-
       poses, though, a key size of 1024 should be enough.

       There are two steps at which a random integer (modulo p)  needs  to  be
       generated.  On the server side, this is done using OpenSSL's big number
       random generator BN_rand, which "generates a  cryptographically  strong
       pseudo-random  number"  (see  man  3 BN_rand). On the client side, each
       implementation should take care of this, as knowledge of the  exponents
       voids the logarithm problem.
<strong>
EXIT STATUS</strong>
       The exit status is 0 on successful completion and non-zero otherwise.

<strong>BUGS</strong>
       There are no known bugs up to date.
