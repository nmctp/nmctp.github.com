title: nokey-0.1 released

<p><strong>nokey-0.1</strong> is out. The <code>no_key_server</code> is a utility for providing secure authentication through an insecure channel using Shamir&#8217;s no key (or three-pass) protocol over the group of units Z/p (p being a large prime number,  designated from now on as the modulus).</p>
<p>The  advantages  of  the three-pass protocol for authentication are mainly two: that passwords are not sent in the clear over the communication channel and that it  needs  no  certificates  or  the overload  of  Public Key Infrastructure (the authentication server might as well fix a new modulus for each authentication attempt, though this would be very resource-intensive).</p>
<p>Moreover, many of the Web 2.0 services, such as blogs,  chat  services,  and  wikis  require  only secure  authentication  (in  other words, that the login/password pair is only known to the owner) because virtually all of their content is made public.</p>
<p>Users of webmail servers may also be eager to trade non-privacy  of  their  mail  (letting  it  go through  the  web on the clear) for secure authentication (safe encryption of the login protocol). Actually, they are trading for nothing nowadays in most cases.</p>
