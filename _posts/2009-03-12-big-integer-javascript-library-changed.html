title: Big Integer javascript library changed
---

<p>We start the concept tests of No Key and Poorman's PKCS with the <a href="http://www.leemon.com/crypto/BigInt.html">Leemon Big Integer javascript library</a>. Its code defines a <em>bigInt library</em> for arbitrary-precision integers.</p>
<p>After some tests, we have had to looking for another library because it was very slow and the login process took too much time.</p>
<p>So now we use the <a href="http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/jsbn/">jsbn library</a>, which is a pure JavaScript implementation of arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic and after some tests it is pretty faster than the former.</p>
